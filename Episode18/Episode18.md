##CSS Size units %, px, vw, vh, em & rem
##H/W
1. difference b/w physical & logical pixel
2. ppi vs dpi
    Pixels per inch (PPI) refers to the number of pixels contained within each inch of a digital image.
    DPI stands for Dots per Inch, referring to the number of ink droplets a printer will produce per inch while printing an image. The more dots of ink per inch the picture has, the more detail you will see when printed.
3. play with em & rem for padding
    depending on what font-size we set in the parent container, the child container padding will be multiplied with the font size only.
