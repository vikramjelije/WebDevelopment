##Box Model
Anything will be rendered in a rectangular box
    1. Content
    2. Padding
    3. Border
    4. Margin

##H/W
    1. why height & width not applicable on span tag
    An inline element is an element thatâ€™s width and height are determined by the content it contains. Inline elements, such as a <span>, will completely ignore the width and height as well the the top and bottom margin properties because, well, the content is what determines the dimensions. 
    2. Box sizing why its value is mostly border-box
